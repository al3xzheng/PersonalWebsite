            <h1>URA1 Mayer Lab Chip test fixture and Temperature chamber models and 3D-printing</h1>
            <p>
                Here I designed a 28 holed connectors test fixture to accomodate 28 banana plugs. Banana plug models were
                considered to ensure referencing of dimensions was accurate. Consideration to the proto board and Zero-force 
                IC mount were made to ensure accurate dimensions. Many variations of designed were made to ensure the best test fixture 
                model was selected. Other things that were considered for optimization of models was the intuitive numbering of the 28 holes for the 
                test fixture. All in all, I designed a test fixture, heater reference, fan reference, heater box, fan box w/ convection and bridging, friction fit,
                and multiple test prints to gauge and extract info from. I designed these in solidworks, becoming familiar with solidworks,
                and became a rapid prototyper with 3d-printing. Testing and getting my information to get the most optimizable results.
                IN summary, I designed prints and prints to test prints to get the best prints. <br> I will upload the parts once the final
                product is done.

                <span class="title">Upcycling Projects:</span> <br><br>1st - I built a briefcase from a broken monitor, wood, and screws. I used
                tools such as screwdrivers, hammers, glue, saws, rulers, and much more. 2nd - I built 
                a multi-use "fun" roller out of an old cabinet, old lamp, a broken chopstick, a fidget 
                spinner bearing, an old computer, a toilet paper role, unused wire cables, nails, screws,
                wood, and so much more. I used tools such as screwdrivers, hammers, tape, electric saws,
                saws, rulers, and much more. I built these cool gadgets that are mostly unused at the moment
                , but I got to win my school Upcycling Competition for two years, back-to-back, being
                the Upcycling Champion! Most importantly, I used and developed my Creativity, brainstorming,
                and hands-on skills!

                    This is the To-Scale AirBus A380 aircraft. Following the schematic (right) on the airplane, I have modelled the aircraft.
                    You can see the fuselage, the belly, the wing, and the vertical stabilizer. The other wing and horizontal stabilizer are still in progress.
                    This project really expanded my horizons on the capabilities of SolidWorks. I have really dialed in my skills in SolidWorks and learned how to use pierce, 
                    project curves, convert entities, loft, and much more. This project was a grind, but worth it; a highlight was when creating the fuselage and belly, where I really enjoyed using
                    math and ratios to shape out the shapes to loft. This required some thought, and especially on the belly, where the bottom is horizontal.
                    Long story short, I am satisfied on the shaping of the aircraft. This project aimed to reinforce, dial in, and expand my SolidWorks skillset. I am
                    super excited on what I can create next!

                    The stabilizers, the other wing, and the aethetics windows are still a work in progress.

                    This is a traditional trampoline design. The top of the mat is exactly 1 metre off the ground. The circular orientation of the legs of the trampoline and
                    the making of the springs were the most difficult. The clipping network that connects the spring to mat was not difficult but time consuming.
                    I am very proud on my trampoline design as it is very sleek and clean, and inspired by my own trampoline.

                    The springs hold the mat in place for bounce.

                    This is a sturdy-designed cup on top of a frilled saucer. The cup is 8 cm in diameter and 8.5 cm tall.
                    The cup has a 4.225 cm long handle, making the cup 12.225 cm at the longest. The saucer is 16 cm wide in diameter. The cup and saucer
                    are each one solidworks part each, as such, many planes were used for the cup and handle attachment.
                    <br>
                    The cup's handle is inspired from springs and the saucer expresses some juxtaposition.

                    This is a 4 legged chair with a seat that is 18 inches from the ground. It is 4 feet tall in total. The design was not inspired by anything
                    and was created from free-form creativity. I am proud of this design as it was my first solidworks project that I finished and I worked on it with my sister.
                    I learned a lot from this project, especially on the joy, capabilities, and problem-solving involved with SolidWorks and CAD.

                    This is a ceramic through-hole capacitor I designed with the maximum capacitance of a 3 digit capacitor code. Although simple, yet sleek, it was relatively
                    tricky to design given how seemingly trivial it is.
                    <br>
                    Due to my interest in Hardware, I was inspired to design and create this such that I could 3-d print it and keep it as a collectible. It was 3-d printed using
                    its g-code and Cura.
