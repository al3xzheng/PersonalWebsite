                This is going to be short since going into detail about a co-op job would be too long and not necessary. I learned SQL and SQL servers (esp. Oracle), implemented
                Python for scripting purposes, Learned a lot on Jakarata Enterprise Edition and Oracle WebLogic servers. Learned OOP, DI, singletons, interfaces, javaBeans, POJO,
                etc.. Learned Git and am now quite familiar with it. A git pull is a git fetch and merge. Wrote wikis and documentation which was honestly really fun to coment 
                my impact on to the MTO and to be continually there to help my co-workers through clear, informative docuemntation. Learned Azure and CI and CD and developing in 
                a cloud environment. Worked with the introduction of Mobile Camera Units, which allow remote cities in Ontario to take photos for their driver's license and process
                any problems regarding driver's license by giving them connection to our mainframe system. This was a highlight working on setting up camera and sigpads with workstations
                and simulating taking photos and their processing; UAT is honestly fun. Considered edge cases such as twins, fraud cases, invalid photos (hair too long, slight face,
                unclosed mouth, etc..). Another big part was test cases. I wrote test cases using Nunit for .NET apps and test cases using SoapUI (endpoint testing) for WebLogic servers using 
                WSDL, XML, and XSD files. Writing these test cases were like solving a puzzle! I made a lot of friends, worked with other students from Waterloo, learned
                a lot, e.g networking and security, and loved the environment!

                I created an Add-in in Solidworks that would be able to take inputted files .prt or .ass files and quote the price to 3d print said part of assembly
                based on complexity Algorithms via the SolidWorks API. First, how do you inject an application in to another application, you use COM Interop. Component Object 
                Model Interopability. Using this and DI (dependency injection) principles we can create our add in in Solidworks with the help of Windows Forms UIs, C#, .NET, And
                most importantly, the SolidWorks Api. So far i Have created this add-in. See my github. Something that is a big problem is the monster that is the SolidWorks API,
                the documentation is extremely hard to understand and seems unnnavigatable. So we use the help of the SolidDNA library which can call the SolidWorks API for us. The only
                problem, being that the creator has disabled it... Ideas generation.

                This is a PyGame developed top-down shooter game where you try to kill enemies, dodge enemy projectiles, and survive for
                as many waves as possible! <br><br>
    
                This game was created from September 2023-December 2023 with Parsia Nejad-Sattary and Sean Yuen as part of a project for our programming (Python)
                course. I was responsible for the enemy-fire functions; the tracking of the enemy projectiles to the player periodically. The way it works.
                Each enemy's location is stored in a list, so while the round is active, we copy the exact location of each enemy and the player at a 
                given point in time (simple). Then we run through a for-loop for each enemy and generate a rotated-accordingly projectile directed at the 
                player. The projectiles are locked in this direction and move towards the player (which the player will dodge). 
                Ongoing, we have a counter that keeps track of the projectiles that leave the screen or hit the player, once all the projectiles are nullified, 
                the firing restarts. The complexities of this task were found in its integration in the code as Sean implemented the enemy-follow functions beforehand, 
                and debugging the occurence when the enemy is killed while the projectile is also nullified. This was very time-consuming to debug. The solution was found
                through asking myself "what exactly is the problem to solve?" over and over again. If the enemy is killed and the projectile is out of the screen, the counter would be bugged
                and the game wouldn't reset properly.
