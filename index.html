                    <div class="blog-content3">
                        <p>Late night writing for me. There is virtually no benefit to social media at all. I'm talking about Youtube, Instagram, Reddit,
                            Twitch, WhatsApp, these mentioned medias are the ones I mainly use. What I'm talking about is the main reason we all use social media 
                            for,
                            to get "Surprised". We go to social media for no purpose at all but to get surprised. To simply waste time and think a random/surprise dopamine hit
                             will somehow
                            refuel us or make us happier or somehow more productive. I'm telling you right now, stop going to social media, social media will come to you.
                            When you're seeking that particular knowledge, social media actually, but unlikely, provide it to you. And that's the only time social media will be helpful.
                            The only time such reason why getting surprised by social media may be beneficial is if you have no common sense. And I know you do. 
                            Let me give you an example, the news. You see that someplace is dangerous for example; you see Jane and Finch is a 
                            apparentl the most dangerous place in Toronto #Propoganda. So then you don't go out at night when you're in that area. But this
                            information/propoganda you just obtained could've been just common sense by researching before you go there and assessing the environment
                            there. So I just want to hammer that social media is practically all negatives.
                            Now, I want to talk about being lazy. I hate how people say that smart people are lazy and 
                            how they are inherently lazy.
                            The only thing that accomplishes is when you say it to your worst enemy. Who would allow themself to be a lazy sack and allow themselves to brainrot?
                            It literally doesn't make sense. Why would smart people allow themselves to lose their life and to mentally decay. 
                            I'm convinced this is some wily, crafty claim meant to trick or convince people/themselves. It's evil really.
                            So stop being lazy and stop engaging
                            with social media. Please don't tell social media to "Surprise me!" and say "Well I'm just a lazy person, I'll solve the world 
                            later, Cuz I'm SMaRt". Get focused!

                        <p class="blog-date">July 20, 2024</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content2">
                        <p>Something I came to realize is that learning is not the same as working. When you're
                            working on a project, there are two parts, the learning and the working. The learning is the understanding of what
                            to do, why you do it this way, and what the results mean. Working is the setting of everything up, scheduling the workflow,
                            and thinking about how the steps interact. Working uses current knowledge and is like solving a puzzle. Something I realized
                            is that while working is quantized by getting something done, learning is not. So people generally try to work more efficiently to get
                            something done or configured. And you CAN do that, that's good, since once you figure something out, its done. But for learning,
                            you should actually try to take it slow and be inefficient. You should try to explore things and form new conclusions. So what I learned
                            is that rushing work is OK, but rushing learning is very bad. Try to be inefficient, and read and understand every word. Form connections
                            from what you previously know. A project is not a bunch of work that needs get done and the pursuit of the final object. There is a lot
                            of learning, and that learning needs to be done well and slowly and methodically. This learning is the most important thing of a project
                            that makes sure the project comes to completion, not the work, if you understand what I mean.

                        <p>If you ain't busy or find yourself having nothing to do sometimes, just idling
                            around watching youtube or walking around doing nothing, even after you finish
                            some amount of work, it means you ain't busy and that you ain't got anything to do!
                            Get something to do. Why don't you better yourself and get some stuff done, whether that be learning or building something?
                            It will improve your ability in whatever field or thing you would want to get better or know more about.
                            Build your To-Do list of projects, tasks, and goals. One should
                            always be busy and be in that stress of, "So many things I have to do, I might not
                            make it. I probably won't be able to do everything, but I'll try". If you don't feel
                            busy, it means you aint, put more things on your 'things to do to grow' list, and get to work
                            on making yourself better. 
                            One
                            should not have time to idle around and take breaks if one is truly busy and working
                            on better themselves! So, reflect back on how you feel and primarily think: "Do I have
                            time to take breaks?". If yes, sorry, you ain't busy at all; use these precious moments to
                            better yourself or other. Put more things on your plate and 
                            feel that pressure and healthy stress to become better. Also a good indicator is how
                            you spend your mornings. You should be gunning to get to work!
