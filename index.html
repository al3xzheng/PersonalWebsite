                I am in the top 1% of all solvers on Project Euler. These
                questions are number theory based math puzzles: Overflow problems, Primes (babylonian method!), Sequences, Inverses, Modulo congruence,
                Chinese Remainder Theorem. These questions are so rewarding because they make me smarter and make me happy.
                I get to learn fundamental principles of math whilst becoming a better problem-solver.

                    <p id="link">https://projecteuler.net/progress=alexzheng</p>
                </a>
                These questions give me a better grasp of all problems.
                I'm starting to see benefits, when seeing problems in school, I can take a quicker glance to solve it. Ultimately, I'm growing
                the skill to look at problem and instantly get the solution idea. <br> <br>
                I used to also solve Jane Street Monthly Puzzles, these are puzzles provided by Jane Street. I have solved 3. These puzzles are so rewarding Due
                to their dificulty and inherent nature. The reason I like puzzles is because it doesn't require you to learn another concept
                in order to solve said problme, maybe you have to learn some math concepts e.g. probability, modulo, but this information
                is applicable everywhere!

                    </div>

                        <p>
                            12:51 right now. Waiting to head onto the GO Bus back to Square one in QNC right now. Finished MTE 252
                            exam at 10:30 then rowed an 8:04 2k. <br><br>
                            This is What I learned from the exams.
                            1) I feel that I write really fast, so I am able to do the naive approach, which works, but is objectively
                            slower, although it is more active. I learned that my fear of being slow and stagnant is greater than my
                            fear of not solving the problem in the most optimal manner. I really want to go fast. But I learned that
                            it's not about doing a method that works the quickest (this I can do in my sleep), but it's about finding
                            the fastest method first, and doing that fast. 2 methods, same solution, the faster one is generally better.
                            But sometimes doing the slower method is more fortuitous. Anyways, more methods is always better. So, I learned
                            that just becaues I can do a problem in a gaurantted way, and just write very fast, doesn't mean its actually the fastest 
                            although it feels fast, because, i'm writing pen to paper.
                            2) Studying is a "questioning battle". Overstudying is a real problem. But, it is my belief that the result you get on an exam
                            is the same result you would've gotten without studying. Studying just reduces cognitive load, which isn't a problem during 
                            your primal exam state, where you have the will to derive equatoins and cognitive load isn't a problem. So I learned that 
                            studying is really just questioning oneself. Overstudying yields to mindlessness, like in point 1. Where you just do any method,
                            One needs to be calm and overstudying generates anxiety and dumb methods (that do work) though.
                            3) I learned that I don't need to study so much, I'll still work super hard, but on questioning myself and 
                            my knowledge, rather than being in papers and lessons. I'll work on my social skills and become smarter in choosing 
                            the fastest method, rather doing a method in the fastest way. I'll study by being productive and study like solving a problem 
                            rather than trying to find problems.

                            Sunday before reading week starts. I just got tricked after doing the MTE 203 quiz. <br>
                            Here are my problem solving axioms. <br> <br>
                            1. Be Very Careful
                            2. Read the (f***ing) Question. A key parameter (subset of 1.)
                            3. Think Harder. If you feel you're getting stuck, just think harder.
                            4. Don't always think mentally, just start writing, and ideas can come. But Be Very Careful.
                            5. Many problems can be solved algebraically, don't need to generate an algorithm/pathway to a solution. 
                            It can just arise algebraically. This and 4. kind of match (to me). Algebraic thinking means knowing
                            what you want, and trying to achieve it.

                            <br><br>
                            "The difference is in the Mindset. Humble Yourself and be Very Careful; Don't be Afraid. 
                            Read and understand the question, and Think Harder. Think on paper, be Algebraic."

                            This is an actual current though on Aug 26th. I'm currently seeing that as I'm getting older, I'm losing the ability 
                            to focus. I'm not sure if it's due to long term fatigue (the past 2 years of university) since I'm going to 3rd year, and that I've 
                            been worn down in a way. But before I uesd to get super motivated and be able to hyper focus, now, it's getting harder. Mind you, it's the 
                            break between Coop and School, but I'm definitely becoming more distracted and less motivated. Just getting some work is Ok to me now. 
                            I'm more easy on myself on working, and I find it hard to study for 2 hours (self-study).

                            This blog would actually be me catching up on my thinkings on Sunday August 17th 2025, the day I realized I was 
                            all alone in my Room. I was on coop in Spring 2025, and my friends on study term, so when their exams ended on
                            August 15th and they had all moved out on August 17th, I realized why it is so important to be with others. Being with 
                            others makes you more conscious of your own actions/behaviours. And being conscious of what you do is important in being self-aware and 
                            becoming a better person. This applies both in every aspect. If you want to become better at anything, do it with others. Doing it with 
                            others makes you more conscious of your mistakes, or what you are doing. Not to say, you're just held more accountable in situation 
                            dealing with others, but one simply unconsciously thinks about others when being with others and this is highly beneficial. When you 
                            realize that everyone is going through life and that whatever bad has happened, other peoples' time other has gone by, and it is just a 
                            passing of time almost. What I'm trying to say is that struggles are more seen as part of life when you live with others, as you subconsciously 
                            see other peoples' journey and know that it's all a journey. Additionally, simple things become conscious when living with others. A key 
                            fact is that you become more conscious of what you do. Not in feeling self-conscious/shy, but you realize what is right for you to do 
                            because you know what other people should/ shouldn't be doing. For example, if you should be reading, but you just came back from work and want 
                            to watch Youtube videos, seeing other people, makes you, one, externalize your inner desires, and you see that it's just your conscience, and two, 
                            seeing others makes you realize that I should probably just read. I think that when one sees someone, you subconsciously see yourself 
                            in that person in a way. And you see yourself in a way such that you subconsciously apply what they/you should be doing, such that you then
                            do the right thing.
                            <br>
                            I know firsthand how easy it is to waste entire days without energy; not knowing why you just can't get to work or do anything productive. 
                            "Why can't I help myself?" "Why am I just ruining myself, I'm not getting any joy from wasting my time, but I can't do anything else". 
                            Yes, some things are difficult to achieve. But I believe this was because I was living alone and had no inner motivation and perspective on life. 
                            Since I was all alone, I had no accountability to myself or others. I had no conscience telling me what I should be or should not be doing. I had no inspiration 
                            in other people to aid in my life. I was super motivated to do work, but couldn't do it because no one was with me. And it just felt so 
                            suffocating.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Being with others makes you conscious and aware of what you do, because we see ourselves in others. Also we do a lot of things for others and to better our lives 
                            to better other peoples' lives. So be with good people you care about, and that care about you!

                            Good things happen to everyone, which we do not deserve. I do not deserve
                            the ability to go to university and all the opportunities I have. I am a terrible
                            person; I sin a lot and do evil things. And neither do you. We don't deserve the 
                            good things that we experience, and we don't deserve our platform that we are given.
                            Why can't a kid in Africa go to a university with coop and have the resources and 
                            opportunities for a relatively good life where our children can have one too. I know I am in a better state to be born in. 
                            And you too (probably). We must do good to others and to try to help lift others up. If
                            we don't, we simply are neglecting the goodness giving to us. And even those who are moreso 
                            in an undeserved state than us, we must also help them, because as God as helped us so 
                            undeservingly, so we must help others, even those moreso undeservingly in a "better" position, 
                            but the most, the people who are less fortunate. We, I, simply don't deserve the possibility of a 
                            beautiful life, no one does, for we all are terrible. So, as God has loved me, I will love others.

                            I will not compete with others to actively be better and put others down. For who am I that 
                            I think I am better than others? I didn't earn anything, no wage, for my merits. Another person 
                            doesn't even have the ability to express their merits! I will put God first, who loved me and 
                            forgave my sins. I will then try to lift everyone around me up, showing my gratefulness. 
                            I will continue through my life with the goodness giving to me by God and 
                            try my best to follow God and to live for God and not to sin. I will not chase my form of happiness, 
                            that which I do not deserve, but, I will simply try to be the best person I can be, and live up to
                            God's grace! And this is a wonderful goal: to do what is good.

                            I must be grateful, loving to others, and try my best to be good. I won't be afraid of humanly things, 
                            for why should I be afraid of another terrible human?

                        <p>Late night writing for me after the first week of school on Saturday night at 11:00 p.m.. I just had a discussion with some friends on problem-solving and coding problems. 
                            We talked on software and the necessity of certain tools to solve certain problems and gave each other interesting problems to solve. Before I used to think
                            software, as a sector, was very rote and memorization based. You have this toolbelt and given a problem, you choose the most applicable and efficient tool.
                            I only appreciated the problem-solving and math-y aspect of it, not the "use this" and "use that" philosphy which is heavily based on memorization and knowledge.
                            But then I realized this: every career path or activity requires problem solving, so you better enjoy it and/or get better at it, but it is with what tools
                            that you want to solve these problems with that shows your passion. What do you want to know more about? What do you want to learn? If this learning is called
                            memorization to you, maybe reconsider this path our going, because it doesn't seem like passion. In my opinion, one's passion is based on the type of tools or domain that one would like to solve problems with.
                            For some it in software, using data structures and niche algorithms, for others, like me, it is with electronics and niche hardware components!

                    <div class="blog-content3">
                        <p>Late night writing for me. There is virtually no benefit to social media at all. I'm talking about Youtube, Instagram, Reddit,
                            Twitch, WhatsApp, these mentioned medias are the ones I mainly use. What I'm talking about is the main reason we all use social media 
                            for,
                            to get "Surprised". We go to social media for no purpose at all but to get surprised. To simply waste time and think a random/surprise dopamine hit
                             will somehow
                            refuel us or make us happier or somehow more productive. I'm telling you right now, stop going to social media, social media will come to you.
                            When you're seeking that particular knowledge, social media actually, but unlikely, provide it to you. And that's the only time social media will be helpful.
                            The only time such reason why getting surprised by social media may be beneficial is if you have no common sense. And I know you do. 
                            Let me give you an example, the news. You see that someplace is dangerous for example; you see Jane and Finch is a 
                            apparentl the most dangerous place in Toronto #Propoganda. So then you don't go out at night when you're in that area. But this
                            information/propoganda you just obtained could've been just common sense by researching before you go there and assessing the environment
                            there. So I just want to hammer that social media is practically all negatives.
                            Now, I want to talk about being lazy. I hate how people say that smart people are lazy and 
                            how they are inherently lazy.
                            The only thing that accomplishes is when you say it to your worst enemy. Who would allow themself to be a lazy sack and allow themselves to brainrot?
                            It literally doesn't make sense. Why would smart people allow themselves to lose their life and to mentally decay. 
                            I'm convinced this is some wily, crafty claim meant to trick or convince people/themselves. It's evil really.
                            So stop being lazy and stop engaging
                            with social media. Please don't tell social media to "Surprise me!" and say "Well I'm just a lazy person, I'll solve the world 
                            later, Cuz I'm SMaRt". Get focused!

                        <p class="blog-date">July 20, 2024</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content2">
                        <p>Something I came to realize is that learning is not the same as working. When you're
                            working on a project, there are two parts, the learning and the working. The learning is the understanding of what
                            to do, why you do it this way, and what the results mean. Working is the setting of everything up, scheduling the workflow,
                            and thinking about how the steps interact. Working uses current knowledge and is like solving a puzzle. Something I realized
                            is that while working is quantized by getting something done, learning is not. So people generally try to work more efficiently to get
                            something done or configured. And you CAN do that, that's good, since once you figure something out, its done. But for learning,
                            you should actually try to take it slow and be inefficient. You should try to explore things and form new conclusions. So what I learned
                            is that rushing work is OK, but rushing learning is very bad. Try to be inefficient, and read and understand every word. Form connections
                            from what you previously know. A project is not a bunch of work that needs get done and the pursuit of the final object. There is a lot
                            of learning, and that learning needs to be done well and slowly and methodically. This learning is the most important thing of a project
                            that makes sure the project comes to completion, not the work, if you understand what I mean.

                        <p>If you ain't busy or find yourself having nothing to do sometimes, just idling
                            around watching youtube or walking around doing nothing, even after you finish
                            some amount of work, it means you ain't busy and that you ain't got anything to do!
                            Get something to do. Why don't you better yourself and get some stuff done, whether that be learning or building something?
                            It will improve your ability in whatever field or thing you would want to get better or know more about.
                            Build your To-Do list of projects, tasks, and goals. One should
                            always be busy and be in that stress of, "So many things I have to do, I might not
                            make it. I probably won't be able to do everything, but I'll try". If you don't feel
                            busy, it means you aint, put more things on your 'things to do to grow' list, and get to work
                            on making yourself better. 
                            One
                            should not have time to idle around and take breaks if one is truly busy and working
                            on better themselves! So, reflect back on how you feel and primarily think: "Do I have
                            time to take breaks?". If yes, sorry, you ain't busy at all; use these precious moments to
                            better yourself or other. Put more things on your plate and 
                            feel that pressure and healthy stress to become better. Also a good indicator is how
                            you spend your mornings. You should be gunning to get to work!
