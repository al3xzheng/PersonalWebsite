                        <p>If you ain't busy or find yourself having nothing to do sometimes, just idling
                            around watching youtube or walking around doing nothing, even after you finish
                            some amount of work, it means you ain't busy and that you ain't got anything to do!
                            Get something to do. Why don't you better yourself and get some stuff done, whether that be learning or building something?
                            It will improve your ability in whatever field or thing you would want to get better or know more about.
                            Build your To-Do list of projects, tasks, and goals. One should
                            always be busy and be in that stress of, "So many things I have to do, I might not
                            make it. I probably won't be able to do everything, but I'll try". If you don't feel
                            busy, it means you aint, put more things on your 'things to do to grow' list, and get to work
                            on making yourself better. 
                            One
                            should not have time to idle around and take breaks if one is truly busy and working
                            on better themselves! So, reflect back on how you feel and primarily think: "Do I have
                            time to take breaks?". If yes, sorry, you ain't busy at all; use these precious moments to
                            better yourself or other. Put more things on your plate and 
                            feel that pressure and healthy stress to become better. Also a good indicator is how
                            you spend your mornings. You should be gunning to get to work!
