                            Studying 2A term of Mechatronics Engineering! Sept 6 - Dec 19.
                            <br><br>

                            Working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant where I am working on building a thermal controlled chamber for an IC/Chip test fixture.
                            The research is based on ultrasonic soldering which i a machine-based soldering method using ultrasonic waves to deoxidize and bond
                            metal-metal, e.g. aluminum-gold. This is used on chip to form connections, but when testing these chips the resistance based on the temperature
                            of the room plays a big part, as resistance is proportional to temperature. I incorporate MCUs, Solidworks CAD Modelling, electrical design,
                            parts sourcing, etc. to build this electromechanical project! Looking forward for cool projects further into the term!
                            <br><br>
                            joined Watonomous, a design team ot build an autonomous car, focused on the vehicle platform team where I work on
                            sensors and interfacing, + Linux, etc..
