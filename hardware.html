                Preview: My 1st project is to build a test fixture with 28 holes for wiring (banana plugs) that will take
                a 28 pin IC for test. The IC will be mounted and secured onto a zero force IC socket mount and the mount will be connected
                and soldered to a proto board. The protoboard will be attached onto the test fixture.
                Each pin of the IC will be connected to a corresponding pin of the test fixture through soldering
                connections to the protoboard and to each of the 28 holes. At each hole, there will be a
                banana plug cables inserted into the test fixture holes, with the bottom end being soldered to the proto board.
                Then when we Want 
                to test, it's just plug and play.
                Therefore, everything will be fixed either by a mount, i.e. the IC socket mount, or by solder.

                For this beautiful project, I designed the circuitry. I thoroughly investigated and learned about my tool, the types of parts
                available to me and optimized, while trying to over-engineer, choosing the right parts. I designed the circuit with
                PMOSFETs, rotary encoders, level shifters, Raspberry pis (our controller), ADCs, buck converters, AC/DC converters. I drew
                up the circuit in a online circuit maker and presented it. Then I learned a very crucial thing, that the circuit you
                make doesn't just have to work nicely, it has to work with the physical components. After designing the circuit, something
                that I am very proud of it being able to optimize even more to adapt the circuit to my surrounding to my advantage. Using JST 
                connectors we cleverly use the protoboard that the chip was on to make power the heaters and fans more internal, covering up their wires,
                but also making it easier to plug and play the heaters and fans because now the JST connetors could just connect whichever device you wanted
                to use, heater, fan, or thermistor!
                <br>
                Additionally, we used self-calibrated thermistors to detect temp with a voltage divider circuit.

            <h1>Cantenna</h1>
            <p class="expl">
                
                I'm currently working on a Coffee Can Antenna. This incorporates many advanced
                components to give and receive an RF signal. Based on the surroundings, the 
                RF signal will vary and the cantenna will act as an Synthetic Aperture
                Radar (SAR) imager. This data can be plotted to form a map of the surrounding
                using MATLAB! Addtionally, on top of being a SAR radar it can be a speed detector by means of the Doppler effect; which expresses the fact that 
                waves travelling from a moving object either travel faster or slower to a target.
                This project was put off for quite a bit due to a component costing an excessive
                amount. I'm just going to attempt to design the component myself in Altium. The voltage controlled oscillator costs upwards to 500$!
                So far I have calculated where the monopole antennas must be placed in the can, from guide and free space wavelength theory and know that I have to create some
                parts from scratch, which will be fun.

            <h1>State of Charge PCB</h1>
            <p>
                In a team setting (school design team), I helped design a PCB that would measure the battery level of the solar car.
                The team already had a shunt resistor, surprisingly massive, and the voltage levels of the battery were known. So we 
                chose the IC to be used. This was fairly researchy and trivial stuff. But then we went on to Altium to build the circuit and lay it out 
                . I learned a lot here. I learned about noise, decoupling caps, FETs, vias, silkscreen and how to use Altium designer!!!
                We sent the circuit for manufacturing, to JLCPCB and it arrived and we assembled it with our Shunt. I also learned that
                we build PCBs around the physical size limitation, the shunt in our case, and how to calculate resistances, since
                in the real world, only certain resistance values are mass produced.
